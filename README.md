### I'm Ben

I live in Belgium & I've been a <del>front-end</del> web-developer since.. 1999 (I guess) when I built my first website at the age of 14!

## More about me

It was then I started experimenting with code & entered the beautiful world of html & css. I'm mostly self-taught with the help of the Internet!

My big passion has always been "building websites", I've seen a major shift in web-development over the last years. I've lived through the "revolution" of tables, floats, flexbox,... There's not a day that goes by where I don't discover a really awesome magnificant website, it's then I can't help but right click & start inspecting how it works!

## My Stack

HTML // CSS // JavaScript // PHP // Visual Studio Code // GitHub // Sketch // Adobe XD //
