## `Hi there` <img src="https://github.com/samfromaway/samfromaway/blob/master/.github/images/fire.gif?raw=true" alt="hello" width="35" height="35"/>

I'm Ben.

I live in Belgium & I've been a <del>front-end</del> web-developer since.. 1999 when I built my first 'website' at the age of 14!

## More about me

It was then I started experimenting with code & entered the beautiful world of html & css. I'm mostly self-taught with the help of the Internet!

My big passion has always been "building websites", I've seen a major shift in web-development over the last years. I've lived through the "revolution" of tables, floats, flexbox,... There's not a day that goes by where I don't discover a really awesome magnificant website, it's then I can't help but right click & start inspecting how it works!

## My interests

`HTML` // `CSS` // `JavaScript` // `PHP` // `SQL` // `API's` // `Visual Studio Code` // `Gulp` // `GitHub` / `GitLab` // `Sketch` // `Adobe XD` // `Photoshop`

## Things I enjoy making

- Responsive websites (from scratch)
- Wordpress (Theme development)
- Hubspot (Theme development)
- PHP API integrations
- Responsive HTML mails (believe me, it's an art)
- Macarons
